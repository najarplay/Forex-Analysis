# Forex-Analysis
This repository is a comprehensive practice for developing a scalable financial analysis application focused on the Forex market. The project is built with a modular architecture that enables experimentation with multiple programming languages (Python, Java, C++, among others) and explores complete workflowsâ€”from data collection to visualization.

## ðŸ”§ Workflow
1. 	Data Collection: Integration with APIs to retrieve real-time market information.
2. 	Data Organization: Creation and structuring of local and SQL databases using best practices.
3. 	Interpretation and Analysis: Processing of economic and financial data to extract meaningful insights.
4. 	Visualization: Implementation of frameworks to represent data in an intuitive and dynamic way.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
To explore the implementation of multiple languages for a single purpose: financial analysis. This repository serves as a technical lab to experiment with practical controllers, function segmentation, and scalable design. No prior knowledge of databases is required, making it an accessible starting point for curious developers and technical analysts.
